# Stephanie Rossouw's Professional Portfolio


This application is a showcase of my first web application made entirely from my own code base.

## Features
The background image in the header is a snip from a photo that was drawn by my daughter, Rayna. 


The background photo used in the about me section is a photo of frost on my drive to work one morning. 

## Functionality
My application is designed to be responsive to different sizes of screen. When the beautiful frost photo becomes covered by overlay on the screen, it is dropped from the background.
